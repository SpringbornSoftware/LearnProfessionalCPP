# Learn Professional CPP

## Problem
I know C++ but I don't understand how to write professional code for other to 
use.

## Solution
Read through books written by the creator of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) to better 
understand the nuances of the language and the idle way to write maintainable 
clean maintainable code and demonstrate my understanding of the language through
my own examples demonstrating the various concepts.

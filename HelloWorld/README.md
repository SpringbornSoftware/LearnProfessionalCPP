# Hello World
An example of a simple program implemented in C++ using the Windows Subsystem.

## Objective
Demonstrate the most basic form of a windows program.

# Review questions
1. The purpose of the "Hello World" program is to introduce new programmers to 
the basics concepts of programming.
2. The four parts of a function is the return type, the function name, the input
parameters, and the function body.
3. The function that must appear in every C++ program is the main function. In
Windows, you use the WinMain function instead which has Windows specific 
parameters.
4. The purpose of the return state in "Hello World" is to return error codes 
back to the operating system.
5. The compiler turns human readable source code into machine code.
6. The import statement (which isn't currently working due to an error std 
module) is used to import the standard library into the program.
7. Include directives add header files to the top of our source files. This 
allows the computer to know what functions are available to use in the program.
8. The .cpp suffix at the end of a file indicates that a file is source code.
9. The linker, connects our compiles source files together into our executable 
or library file.
10. The difference between a source file and an object files is that a source 
file is human readable code, while an object file is machine code ready to be 
linked. 
11. An executable is a compiled program that can be run by the computer.
12. An IDE is an integrated development environment. That allows for easier 
development by providing all the required tools IE: text editor, compiler, 
linker, for building a program. It also offers a nice suite of extra features 
such as debuggers.
13. To run a compiled program you can double click on it, or run it via command 
line using a command such as ./HelloWorld.exe.
14. A comment is a line of text ignored by the compiler and meant to clarify
obscure parts of the code.
15. The purpose of a drill is to imbed through repetition the important concepts.
16. It's necessary to practice even if you understand things in order to 
maintain professional level performance.

## Personal takeaway
Programming is the act of creating solutions to problems in a way that the 
computer can execute. Computers unlike humans can't infere what we want and must
be provided with clear and concise instructions on how to execute said solution.
Programs are written to be executed by the computer but must be readable by 
other people. Therefore code must be written in a clean maintable way that can 
be read by someone unfamiliar with the code.
